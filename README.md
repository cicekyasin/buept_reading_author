# FLED-AI: AI-Powered Reading Material Generator for L2 Learners

A web application that generates pedagogically-leveled English reading materials for second language (L2) learners using AI and structured constraints.

## 🚀 Overview

As a FLED (Foreign Language Education) student, I built this tool to address the challenge of creating accessible, level-appropriate reading materials for English language learners. The application uses AI with carefully designed pedagogical constraints to ensure texts are both engaging and educationally appropriate.

**Live Demo**: [https://fled-l2-reading-designer-827046456767.us-west1.run.app](https://fled-l2-reading-designer-827046456767.us-west1.run.app)

## ✨ Features

- **AI-Powered Generation**: Creates reading materials on any topic using modern AI
- **Pedagogical Constraints**: Implements research-backed controls for L2 readability:
  - Controlled Average Sentence Length (ASL) to reduce cognitive load
  - Avoidance of complex grammatical structures (e.g., passive voice)
- **Teacher-Friendly**: YADYOK teachers can generate clean PDF outputs in seconds
- **Modern Stack**: Built with TypeScript and deployed on Google Cloud Run

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: TypeScript (99%), HTML
- **Backend**: Node.js with TypeScript
- **AI Integration**: Custom prompt engineering with LLM APIs
- **Deployment**: Google Cloud Run (containerized)
- **Version Control**: GitHub

## 🎯 Pedagogical Foundation

This tool implements principles from FLED methodology:
- Comprehensible input through controlled sentence complexity
- Reduced L2 anxiety through predictable grammatical structures
- Scaffolded learning through leveled text generation
